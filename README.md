THE FOLLOWING TOOLS, CONCEPTS, AND CLASSES HAVE BEEN USED:

JAVA.NET.SERVERSOCKET: TO CREATE A SERVER THAT LISTENS FOR INCOMING CLIENT CONNECTIONS.

JAVA.NET.SOCKET: TO ESTABLISH CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CLIENTS AND THE SERVER.

JAVA.IO.PRINTWRITER & BUFFEREDREADER: TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES VIA INPUT AND OUTPUT STREAMS.

JAVA.LANG.THREAD / MULTITHREADING: TO HANDLE MULTIPLE CLIENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY BY ASSIGNING EACH CLIENT TO A SEPARATE THREAD.

JAVA.IO.INPUTSTREAMREADER & OUTPUTSTREAMWRITER: TO READ AND WRITE CHARACTER DATA.

JAVA IDE (E.G., INTELLIJ IDEA OR ECLIPSE): FOR WRITING, COMPILING, AND RUNNING THE CODE.

JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT (JDK 11 OR ABOVE): REQUIRED FOR USING MODERN JAVA FEATURES.

THIS APPLICATION IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF NETWORK PROGRAMMING AND MULTITHREADING IN JAVA. IT CAN BE EXTENDED TO SUPPORT GUI, USER AUTHENTICATION, MESSAGE BROADCASTING, AND MORE.
